Effects are a way to add interesting procedural movement to various objects in your world.  You can either apply an effect to a qb2Tangible manually, or add it to a qb2Tangible's effects array, where it will be applied every frame automatically.

Effects are reusable, meaning the same effect can be applied to multiple different qb2Tangible instances.  You can think of them as the physics-engine equivalent of BitmapFilter's in Flash.

Effects are meant to be extensible, so add your own.  If you think you have a good one, submit it to the open source project.
