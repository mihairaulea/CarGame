- make a contains function for polygon

- test curve splitting

- test subcurve thing and getsplitCurves for polyline

- copy/paste/reuse code from polygon for polyline




IN THE FUTURE

- have grid consider infinite lines and rays

- implement circle and arc classes

- make ellipse class

- implement bound circle class

- possibly move some functions in boundbox up to the abstract class so bound circle implements them too

- implement a plane class

- have a planar entity base class (?)

- implement area function for polyline

- draw as spline for polyline

- implement matrix class and implenent transformBy for point and vector

- clean up grid class

- implement getIntersection for bound box

- get boundBox for polygon class...also have contains/intersects functions.
